# Pair Up Chrom (TMS Version)
Skyline visual plugin which incorporates Robin's Chrom article and spawns him with normal moves and aerials. Includes Chrom's default animations and retargeted ones to better match Robin's. Also reincorporates Chrom's default effects for each attack. 

#### General Changes
Chrom will appear behind Robin in the following animations:
* Taunts
* Tilts
* Smash Attacks
* Aerials
* Dash Attack

Note that if Robin lands onto the ground normally (not during an aerial) or when taking damage, Chrom will immediately despawn. Note that this is purely visual as there are no hitboxes attached to Chrom himself.

Also incorporated are certain effects transplanted from Chrom via the effect converter. This does require one slot effects proper in order to not adversely affect Robin's other slots.

Requires Smashline 2 and the latest versions of Skyline and ARCropolis.
